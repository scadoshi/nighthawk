# nighthawk

Log-structured key-value store in Rust.

Named after the Common Nighthawk — a bird that persists through change.

## Running

### CLI

Interactive terminal interface:

```
cargo run --bin cli
```

### TCP server

```
cp .env.template .env
cargo run --bin server
```

The server reads `ADDRESS` and `PORT` from `.env` (default template: `127.0.0.1:3000`).

Connect with netcat:

```
nc 127.0.0.1 3000
```

Multiple clients can connect concurrently — each connection gets its own thread, sharing the same underlying store.

### Tests

```
cargo test
```

99 tests covering unit, integration, and end-to-end TCP server behavior.

## Commands

```
set <key> <value>    (alias: s)
get <key>            (alias: g)
delete <key>         (alias: d, del)
quit                 (alias: q, exit)
help                 (alias: h)
```

Works identically in the CLI and over TCP.

## How it works

Nighthawk is an LSM-tree (Log-Structured Merge-tree) key-value store.

**Write path**
- Writes append to a write-ahead log (WAL) and update an in-memory `BTreeMap` (the memtable)
- Each entry is wrapped in a 10-byte header: `[magic: 2B][crc32: 4B][entry_len: 4B]`
- Magic bytes (`0x4E48` / "NH") mark entry boundaries for corruption recovery
- CRC32 checksums detect corrupt entries; the reader scans byte-by-byte past bad data
- `sync_all()` is called after every write for durability
- When the memtable exceeds 4MB, it is flushed to a new timestamped SSTable file

**Read path**
- Reads check the memtable first, then scan SSTable files newest-to-oldest
- Each SSTable has a bloom filter (k=7, 10 bits/key, ~1% false positive rate) for fast negative lookups
- SSTable filenames are microsecond Unix timestamps, zero-padded — lexicographic order = chronological order

**Deletes**
- Delete writes a tombstone entry to both the WAL and memtable
- Tombstones propagate through SSTables to prevent resurrection of flushed keys
- Compaction drops tombstone winners so they don't accumulate

**Compaction**
- Every 10 flushes, all SSTables are merged via a k-way merge
- Files are processed in sorted key order simultaneously; the newest SSTable wins on duplicate keys
- Original SSTables are replaced by the compacted output

**Concurrency**
- The `Log` is wrapped in `Arc<Mutex<Log>>` and shared across connection threads
- Locking is per-command, not per-connection — threads only hold the lock for a single operation

Data is stored in `data/` in the working directory, created on first run.
